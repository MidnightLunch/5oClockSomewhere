5 O'Clock Somewhere Tracker
A sleek, interactive web application that shows where in the world it's currently 5 PM (or approaching that time), built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Overview
This application tracks the movement of the "5 o'clock line" around the globe, showing locations where it's currently approaching, exactly at, or just past 5 PM (within a 4:00-6:00 PM window). It uses timezone calculations to display this information in real-time and features a countdown to 5 PM in the user's local timezone.
Features

Real-time Location Tracking: Identifies and displays global locations currently in the 4:00-6:00 PM window
Time Proximity Indicators: Color-coded system showing exactly how close each location is to 5:00 PM
Local Countdown Timer: Shows precise time remaining until the next 5:00 PM in the user's timezone
Responsive Design: Optimized for all device sizes with a modern, card-based interface
Timezone Database: Comprehensive coverage of global time zones including fractional offsets

Technical Implementation
The application is built as a self-contained HTML file with no external dependencies, making it easy to deploy anywhere. Key implementation features include:

Vanilla JavaScript: No frameworks or libraries required
Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Efficient rendering of location data
Time Calculation Algorithm: Precise timezone offset calculations
Responsive CSS: Mobile-first design with flexible layouts

Future Enhancements
World Map Visualization
A planned enhancement includes an interactive world map showing the 5 PM line as it moves across the globe:

SVG-based world map with timezone boundary overlays
Dynamic highlighting of the current 4:00-6:00 PM corridor
Interactive tooltips showing local times on hover
Synchronized highlighting between the map and location list

Deployment
Since this is a single HTML file, deployment is straightforward:

Download the HTML file
Open it in any modern web browser
No server required - runs entirely client-side
